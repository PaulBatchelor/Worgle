* Worgmap (WIP)
Worgmap is a collection of applications designed to
map and display metadata generated from Worgle.

Some ideas here include:

- a local web interface for displaying interactive content
- a static HTML builder (more sophisticated than sorg)
- a plain tex backend
- data visualization using graphiz

But we shall see, really.
