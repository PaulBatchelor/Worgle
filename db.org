#+TITLE: Worgle Database
* Worgle Database (WIP)
This section outlines the portion of Worgle which handles database
export. At the time of writing, this feature does not exist yet.
The main idea behind this is to be able to take a program Org, and
export all the metadata into a SQLite database. In the future, other
programs will be written to query the generated database and dynamically
display portions of the program in interesting ways.

Instead of using the SQLite API to generate the database directly, the Worgle
database interface will write SQL INSERT statements to be read by the sqlite3
command line interface.
